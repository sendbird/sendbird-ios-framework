The object is returned by not only the completion handler of [`addReactionWithMessage:key:completionHandler:`](../Classes/SBDBaseChannel.html#//api/name/addReactionWithMessage:key:completionHandler:) and [`deleteReactionWithMessage:key:completionHandler:`](../Classes/SBDBaseChannel.html#//api/name/deleteReactionWithMessage:key:completionHandler:) in `SBDBaseChannel` class but also [`channel:updatedReaction:`](../Protocols/SBDChannelDelegate.html#//api/name/channel:updatedReaction:) delegate of `SBDChannelDelegate` protocol. The object has to be applied to the message that has the identical message ID with the [`applyReactionEvent:`](../Classes/SBDBaseMessage.html#//api/name/applyReactionEvent:) method in `SBDBaseMessage` class.
